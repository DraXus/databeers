## Abstract

Digital twins are virtual replicas created in the image and likeness of a product, such as an airplane turbine, or a specific location, like an industrial plant. But how do we create a digital twin? If we require a high level of precision, we can use LIDAR to generate a point cloud of a specific location. However, LIDAR devices of good quality are often expensive and challenging to acquire. What if we could represent 3D environments from 2D images using Artificial Intelligence?

Throughout this session, we will explain how the field of novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multiple photos has evolved thanks to the use of techniques based on neural networks, such as Neural Radiance Field methods (NERF) or Gaussian Splatting. The latter does not require neural networks and allows for improved training and rendering times. At the end of the session, we will demonstrate a real example of each technique and how we can interact with different elements found in an industrial plant.
