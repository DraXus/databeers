## Abstract

Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical objects or locations, created with precision using methods like LIDAR. This session explores novel-view synthesis techniques, such as Neural Radiance Field (NERF) and Gaussian Splatting, which can create 3D environments from 2D images. The latter doesn't rely on neural networks, improving training and rendering times. During the presentation, we will explain the fundamental concepts behind these techniques by showcasing real render samples from an industrial plant.
